 * Revision 2.2  2003/09/16 11:56:46  unknownplayer
 * Changed the ship selection window to load the 3D FS2 ship models instead
 * of the custom *.ani files. It just does a techroom rotation for now, but I'll add
 * more features later - tell me of any problems or weirdness caused by it, or if
 * you don't like it and want it as an option only.
