 * Initial checkin - converted filenames and includes to lower case
 *
 * 
 * 5     7/09/99 5:54p Dave
 * Seperated cruiser types into individual types. Added tons of new
 * briefing icons. Campaign screen.
 * 
 * 4     3/26/99 4:49p Dave
 * Made cruisers able to dock with stuff. Made docking points and paths
 * visible in fred.
 * 
 * 3     11/05/98 5:55p Dave
 * Big pass at reducing #includes
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:51a Dave
 * 
 * 46    2/26/98 10:08p Hoffoss
 * Rewrote state saving and restoring to fix bugs and simplify the code.
 * 
 * 45    2/22/98 4:17p John
 * More string externalization classification... 190 left to go!
 * 
 * 44    2/16/98 10:13p Allender
 * initial work on being able to target weapons (bombs specifically).
 * Work on getting rearm/repair working under multiplayer
 * 
 * 43    2/13/98 3:21p Lawrance
 * Set up allowed goals for escape pods.
 * 
 * 42    1/30/98 10:01a Allender
 * made large ships able to attack other ships.  Made goal code recognize
 * when ships removed from wings during ship select
 * 
 * 41    12/15/97 5:25p Allender
 * fix problem with docked ships receiving another dock goal.  They now
 * properly undock
 * 
 * 40    11/17/97 6:39p Lawrance
 * add AI_goal_text[] array, used by HUD code to show text description of
 * order
 * 
 * 39    10/29/97 10:02p Allender
 * be sure that player starting wings that arrive late also form on the
 * players wing if there are no goals
 * 
 * 38    10/23/97 4:41p Allender
 * lots of new rearm/repair code.  Rearm requests now queue as goals for
 * support ship.  Warp in of new support ships functional.  Support for
 * stay-still and play-dead.  
 * 
 * 37    10/22/97 1:44p Allender
 * more work on stay-still and play-dead
 * 
 * 36    10/22/97 11:07a Allender
 * Hooked in form on my wing into Mikes AI code
 * 
 * 35    10/22/97 10:33a Hoffoss
 * Added AI_GOAL_PLAY_DEAD as a valid goal for all ships.
 * 
 * 34    10/22/97 9:54a Allender
 * added ai_goal_play_dead
 * 
 * 33    10/10/97 5:03p Allender
 * started work on ai-stay-still
 * 
 * 32    9/23/97 4:35p Allender
 * added two function to add "internal" goals to ships and wings.  Used by
 * AI when it needs to do something special
 * 
 * 31    8/15/97 11:07a Hoffoss
 * Added warning to help eliminate problems later on down the road.
 * 
 * 30    8/15/97 9:59a Hoffoss
 * Changed ai_query_goal_valid() again.  I can't think of any time you
 * wouldn't find it easier just to pass in a ship instead of a ship_info
 * flag structure filtered of all flags that aren't ship type bits.  Since
 * I'll call this quite a few times, it will make my life easier.
 * 
 * 29    8/14/97 10:00p Allender
 * made ai goals bitfields so that we can have set of orders that certain
 * ship types are allowed to receive.  Added function for Hoffoss to check
 * goal vs. ship type validity
 * 
 * 28    8/12/97 1:55a Hoffoss
 * Made extensive changes to object reference checking and handling for
 * object deletion call.
 * 
 * 27    8/08/97 1:30p Allender
 * added commands (and ai goals) for support ships.  stay near ship (which
 * could be player or current target), and keep safe distance
 * 
 * 26    8/06/97 9:41a Allender
 * renamed from ai_goal function.  made a function to remove a goal from a
 * wing (used strictly for waypoints now).  ai-chase-wing and
 * ai-guard-wing now appear to user as ai-chase and ai-guard.  Tidied up
 * function which deals with sexpression goals
 * 
 * 25    8/06/97 8:06a Lawrance
 * add more stuff to save/restore
 * 
 * 24    7/24/97 4:55p Allender
 * added ai-evade-ship to fred and to Freespace
 * 
 * 23    7/17/97 4:23p Allender
 * ai-guard-wing now in both Fred and Freespace
 * 
 * 22    7/15/97 11:57a Hoffoss
 * Added a general ai goal reference update mode.
 * 
 * 21    6/18/97 11:46a Hoffoss
 * Fixed initial order object reference updating and added briefing dialog
 * window tracking data.
