 * Revision 1.2  2004/09/07 22:56:41  Darkhill
 * -Hopefully fixed a lot of the linker warnings.
 *
 * -Cleaned up some of the interface stuff.
 *
 * -Add a tag to the mission file so that up to three flight groups can be selected to have the player edit ships and weapons.  This gets rid of the old Alpha, Beta, and Gamma groups that were hard coded.

 *
 * Revision 2.50  2003/09/26 14:37:16  bobboau
 * commiting Hardware T&L code, everything is ifdefed out with the compile flag HTL
 * still needs a lot of work, ubt the frame rates were getting with it are incredable
 * the biggest problem it still has is a bad lightmanegment system, and the zbuffer
 * doesn't work well with things still getting rendered useing the sofware pipeline, like thrusters,
 * and weapons, I think these should be modifyed to be sent through hardware,
 * it would be slightly faster and it would likely fix the problem
