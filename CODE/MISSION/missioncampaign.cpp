 * OK, this should be a commit to the DX branch or Im going to be in a lot of trouble.
 * The movie and dx8show files have been cleaned up big time.
 * My debug system is in but has NO EFFECT at all unless a compiler flag is turned on, check h file for details.
 * Aside from that a few changes to help the movie code work properly.
 * Works on most things including GF4 and Voodoo 3. However may not work properly on a voodoo 2.
 * Im going to leave this as a bug for now, serves you right for buying voodoo!
