 * Code to setup matrix instancing and viewers
 *
 * $Log: 3dsetup.cpp,v $
 * Revision 1.2  2004/09/07 22:56:41  Darkhill
 * -Hopefully fixed a lot of the linker warnings.
 *
 * -Cleaned up some of the interface stuff.
 *
 * -Add a tag to the mission file so that up to three flight groups can be selected to have the player edit ships and weapons.  This gets rid of the old Alpha, Beta, and Gamma groups that were hard coded.

 *
 * Revision 2.15  2004/02/13 04:17:14  randomtiger
 * Turned off fog in OGL for Fred.
 * Simulated speech doesnt say tags marked by $ now.
 * The following are fixes to issues that came up testing TBP in fs2_open and fred2_open:
 * Changed vm_vec_mag and parse_tmap to fail gracefully on bad data.
 * Error now given on missing briefing icon and bad ship normal data.
 * Solved more species divide by zero error.
 * Fixed neb cube crash.
 *
 * Revision 2.14  2004/01/17 21:59:54  randomtiger
 * Some small changes to the main codebase that allow Fred_open OGL to compile.
 *
 * Revision 2.13  2003/11/16 04:09:27  Goober5000
 * language
 *
 * Revision 2.12  2003/11/11 18:04:06  phreak
 * made g3_done_instance take a parameter that decides wether to pop the matrix stack.
 * without it, underflows would have been caused
 *
 * Revision 2.11  2003/11/11 03:56:12  bobboau
 * lots of bug fixing, much of it in nebula and bitmap drawing
 *
 * Revision 2.10  2003/11/06 22:49:22  phreak
 * fixed up some of the matrix functions that were causing problems
 * bob: i there is an important change here. i don't know if its going to cause any d3d problems
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2003/11/01 21:59:22  bobboau
 * new matrix handeling code, and fixed some problems with 3D lit verts,
 * several other small fixes
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2003/10/25 06:56:06  bobboau
 * adding FOF stuff,
 * and fixed a small error in the matrix code,
 * I told you it was indeed suposed to be gr_start_instance_matrix
 * in g3_done_instance,
 * g3_start_instance_angles needs to have an gr_ API abstraction version of it made
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2003/10/25 03:27:21  phreak
 * fixed some old bugs that reappeared after RT committed his texture code
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2003/10/23 18:03:24  randomtiger
 * Bobs changes (take 2)
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2003/10/14 17:39:18  randomtiger
 * Implemented hardware fog for the HT&L code path.
 * It doesnt use the backgrounds anymore but its still an improvement.
 * Currently it fogs to a brighter colour than it should because of Bob specular code.
 * I will fix this after discussing it with Bob.
 *
 * Also tided up some D3D stuff, a cmdline variable name and changed a small bit of
 * the htl code to use the existing D3D engine instead of work around it.
 * And added extra information in version number on bottom left of frontend screen.
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2003/10/10 03:59:41  matt
 * Added -nohtl command line param to disable HT&L, nothing is IFDEFd
 * out now. -Sticks
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2003/09/26 14:37:15  bobboau
 * commiting Hardware T&L code, everything is ifdefed out with the compile flag HTL
 * still needs a lot of work, ubt the frame rates were getting with it are incredable
 * the biggest problem it still has is a bad lightmanegment system, and the zbuffer
 * doesn't work well with things still getting rendered useing the sofware pipeline, like thrusters,
 * and weapons, I think these should be modifyed to be sent through hardware,
 * it would be slightly faster and it would likely fix the problem
 *
 * also the thruster glow/particle stuff I did is now in.
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2003/08/09 06:07:24  bobboau
 * slightly better implementation of the new zbuffer thing, it now checks only three diferent formats defalting to the 16 bit if neither the 24 or 32 bit versions are suported
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2002/08/01 01:41:09  penguin
 * The big include file move
 *
 * Revision 2.0  2002/06/03 04:02:28  penguin
 * Warpcore CVS sync
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/05/04 04:52:22  mharris
 * 1st draft at porting
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2002/05/02 18:03:12  mharris
 * Initial checkin - converted filenames and includes to lower case
 *

 * 
 * 22    3/18/98 4:53p John
 * Fixed some bugs with docked ships warping out
 * 
 * 21    3/18/98 4:33p John

 * 
 * 18    3/10/98 4:19p John
 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to

 * 
 * 14    10/29/97 5:05p John
 * Changed dynamic lighting to only rotate and calculate lighting for
 * point lights that are close to an object.  Changed lower framerate cap
 * from 4 to .5.
 * 
 * 13    4/29/97 12:24p Adam
 * JAS:   Added code for delayed point to vec.   Fixed some FRED

 * 
 * 9     3/10/97 2:25p John
 * Made pofview zbuffer.   Made textest work with new model code.  Took
 * out some unnecessary Asserts in the 3d clipper.
 * 
 *

rotation (or g3_code_vertex call) by a vector subtraction and dot

clipped on or off by the plane, and will slow each clipped polygon by
not much more than any other clipping we do.
