/*
 * The Bit Array structure provides a compacted arrays of Booleans, with one bit for each Boolean value.
 * A 0 (1) bit corresponds to the Boolean value false (true), respectively. We can look at a stream of bytes
 * as a stream of bits; each byte contains 8 bits, so any n bytes hold n*8 bits. And the operation to
 * manipulate this stream or bit array is so easy, just read or change the bit's state or make any Boolean
 * operation on the whole bits array, like ‘AND’, ‘OR’, or ‘XOR’.
 *
 * As each byte contains 8 bits, we need to divide the bit number by 8 to reach the byte that holds the bit.
 * Then, we can seek to the right bit in the reached byte by the remainder of dividing the bit number by 8.
 * So to read or change the bit state, the operations will be like that.
 *
 * Note that to divide by 8, we need only to shift right by 3 (>>3), and to get the remainder of dividing
 * by 8, we need only to AND with 7 (&7).
