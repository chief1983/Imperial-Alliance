 * bmpman info that's internal to bmpman related files only
 * 
 * $Log: bm_internal.h,v $
 * Revision 2.3  2005/04/21 15:49:20  taylor
 * update of bmpman and model bitmap management, well tested but things may get a bit bumpy
 *  - use VM_* macros for bmpman since it didn't seem to register the memory correctly (temporary)
 *  - a little "stupid" fix for dds bitmap reading
 *  - fix it so that memory is released properly on bitmap read errors
 *  - some cleanup to model texture loading
 *  - allow model textures to get released rather than just unloaded, saves bitmap slots
 *  - bump MAX_BITMAPS to 4750, should be able to decrease after public testing of new code
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2005/03/03 14:29:37  bobboau
 * fixed a small error from my earlier commit.
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2004/11/23 00:10:06  taylor
 * try and protect the bitmap_entry stuff a bit better
 * fix the transparent support ship, again, but correctly this time
