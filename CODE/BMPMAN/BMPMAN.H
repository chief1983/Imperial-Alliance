 * Uber pass at reducing #includes
 * --Goober5000
 *
 * Revision 2.10  2003/12/04 20:39:08  randomtiger
 * Added DDS image support for D3D
 * Added new command flag '-ship_choice_3d' to activate 3D models instead of ani's in ship choice, feature now off by default
 * Hopefully have fixed D3D text batching bug that caused old values to appear
 * Added Hud_target_object_factor variable to control 3D object sizes of zoom in HUD target
 * Fixed jump nodes not showing
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2003/11/19 20:37:22  randomtiger
 * Almost fully working 32 bit pcx, use -pcx32 flag to activate.
 * Made some commandline variables fit the naming standard.
 * Changed timerbar system not to run pushes and pops if its not in use.
 * Put in a note about not uncommenting asserts.
 * Fixed up a lot of missing POP's on early returns?
 * Perhaps the motivation for Assert functionality getting commented out?
 * Fixed up some bad asserts.
 * Changed nebula poofs to render in 2D in htl, it makes it look how it used to in non htl. (neb.cpp,1248)
 * Before the poofs were creating a nasty stripe effect where they intersected with ships hulls.
 * Put in a special check for the signs of that D3D init bug I need to lock down.
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2003/11/07 18:31:01  randomtiger
 * Fixed a nohtl call to htl funcs (crash with NULL pointer)
 * Fixed a bug with 32bit PCX code.
 * Fixed a bug in the d3d_string batch system that was messing up screen shaking.
 * Added a couple of checks to try and stop timerbar push and pop overloads, check returns missing pops if you use the system.
 * Put in a higher res icon until we get something better sorted out.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2003/10/24 17:35:04  randomtiger
 * Implemented support for 32bit TGA and JPG for D3D
 * Also 32 bit PCX, but it still has some bugs to be worked out
 * Moved convert_24_to_16 out of the bitmap pfunction structures and into packunpack.cpp because thats the only place that uses it.
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2003/08/16 03:52:22  bobboau
 * update for the specmapping code includeing
 * suport for seperate specular levels on lights and
 * optional strings for the stars table
 * code has been made more organised,
 * though there seems to be a bug in the state selecting code
 * resulting in the HUD being rendered incorectly
 * and specmapping failing ocasionaly
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2003/08/12 03:18:32  bobboau
 * Specular 'shine' mapping;
 * useing a phong lighting model I have made specular highlights
 * that are mapped to the model,
 * rendering them is still slow, but they look real purdy
 *
 * also 4 new (untested) comand lines, the XX is a floating point value
 * -spec_exp XX
 * the n value, you can set this from 0 to 200 (actualy more than that, but this is the recomended range), it will make the highlights bigger or smaller, defalt is 16.0 so start playing around there
 * -spec_point XX
 * -spec_static XX
 * -spec_tube XX
 * these are factors for the three diferent types of lights that FS uses, defalt is 1.0,
 * static is the local stars,
 * point is weapons/explosions/warp in/outs,
 * tube is beam weapons,
 * for thouse of you who think any of these lights are too bright you can configure them you're self for personal satisfaction
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2003/03/18 10:07:00  unknownplayer
 * The big DX/main line merge. This has been uploaded to the main CVS since I can't manage to get it to upload to the DX branch. Apologies to all who may be affected adversely, but I'll work to debug it as fast as I can.
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2003/01/19 01:07:41  bobboau
 * redid the way glowmaps are handeled, you now must set the global int GLOWMAP (no longer an array) before you render a poly that uses a glow map then set  GLOWMAP to -1 when you're done with, fixed a few other misc bugs it
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2003/01/18 19:55:16  phreak
 * fixed around the bmpman system to now accept compressed textures
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2003/01/05 23:41:50  bobboau
 * disabled decals (for now), removed the warp ray thingys,
 * made some better error mesages while parseing weapons and ships tbls,
 * and... oh ya, added glow mapping
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.10  2002/11/04 21:24:59  randomtiger
 *
 * When running in D3D all ani's are memory mapped for speed, this takes up more memory but stops gametime locking of textures which D3D8 hates.
 * Added new command line tag Cmdline_d3dlowmem for people who dont want to make use of this because they have no memory.
 * Cleaned up some more texture stuff enabled console debug for D3D.
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.9  2002/11/04 16:04:20  randomtiger
 *
 * Tided up some bumpman stuff and added a few function points to gr_screen. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.8  2002/11/04 03:02:28  randomtiger
 *
 * I have made some fairly drastic changes to the bumpman system. Now functionality can be engine dependant.
 * This is so D3D8 can call its own loading code that will allow good efficient loading and use of textures that it desparately needs without
 * turning bumpman.cpp into a total hook infested nightmare. Note the new bumpman code is still relying on a few of the of the old functions and all of the old bumpman arrays.
 *
 * I have done this by adding to the gr_screen list of function pointers that are set up by the engines init functions.
 * I have named the define calls the same name as the original 'bm_' functions so that I havent had to change names all through the code.
 *
 * Rolled back to an old version of bumpman and made a few changes.
 * Added new files: grd3dbumpman.cpp and .h
 * Moved the bitmap init function to after the 3D engine is initialised
 * Added includes where needed
 * Disabled (for now) the D3D8 TGA loading - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.7  2002/10/26 01:24:22  randomtiger
 * Fixed debug bitmap compiling bug.
 * Fixed tga bug. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.6  2002/10/22 17:46:17  randomtiger
 * Fixed new TGA code texturing bug. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.5  2002/10/21 16:33:40  randomtiger
 * Added D3D only 32 bit TGA functionality. Will load a texture as big as your graphics card allows. Code not finished yet and will forge the beginnings of the new texture system. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.4  2002/10/19 23:56:39  randomtiger
 * Changed generic bitmap code to allow maximum dimensions to be determined by 3D's engines maximum texture size query.
 * Defaults to 256 as it was before. Also added base code for reworking the texture code to be more efficient. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.3  2002/10/02 11:40:19  randomtiger
 * Bmpmap has been reverted to an old non d3d8 version.
 * All d3d8 code is now in the proper place.
 * PCX code is now working to an extent. Problems with alpha though.
 * Ani's work slowly with alpha problems.
 * Also I have done a bit of tidying - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0  2002/06/03 04:02:21  penguin
