 * Revision 2.3  2003/09/16 13:30:16  unknownplayer
 * Minor bugfix to the 3D ship code. There still may be some cases where it will
 * fail to load the model file it needs, but I'm at present mystified as to why.
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2003/09/16 11:56:46  unknownplayer
 * Changed the ship selection window to load the 3D FS2 ship models instead
 * of the custom *.ani files. It just does a techroom rotation for now, but I'll add
 * more features later - tell me of any problems or weirdness caused by it, or if
 * you don't like it and want it as an option only.
