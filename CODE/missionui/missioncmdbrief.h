 * Fixed a few bugs with command brief screen.  Now the voice starts after
 * the text has printed, and options screen doesn't reset cmd brief.
 * 
 * 6     3/26/98 5:24p Hoffoss
 * Changed Command Brief to use memory mapped ani files instead, so we
 * avoid the huge pauses for huge anis that play!
 * 
 * 5     3/19/98 4:25p Hoffoss
 * Added remaining support for command brief screen (ANI and WAVE file
 * playing).
 * 
 * 4     3/17/98 6:26p Hoffoss
 * Added wave filename to command brief structure.
 * 
 * 3     3/05/98 9:38p Hoffoss
 * Finished up command brief screen.
 * 
 * 2     3/05/98 3:59p Hoffoss
 * Added a bunch of new command brief stuff, and asteroid initialization
 * to Fred.
