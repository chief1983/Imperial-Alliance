 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2004/08/13 20:45:47  Darkhill
 * no message
 *
 * Revision 2.11  2004/03/17 04:07:29  bobboau
 * new fighter beam code
 * fixed old after burner trails
 * had to bump a few limits, working on some dynamic solutions
 * a few fixed to background POF rendering
 * fixing asorted bugs
 *
 * Revision 2.10  2004/02/20 21:45:41  randomtiger
 * Removed some uneeded code between NO_DIRECT3D and added gr_zbias call, ogl is set to a stub func.
 * Changed -htl param to -nohtl. Fixed some badly named functions to match convention.
 * Fixed setup of center_alpha in OGL which was causing crash.
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2004/02/15 06:02:31  bobboau
 * fixed sevral asorted matrix errors,
 * OGL people make sure I didn't break anything,
 * most of what I did was replaceing falses with (if graphicts_mode == D3D)
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2004/02/14 00:18:31  randomtiger
 * Please note that from now on OGL will only run with a registry set by Launcher v4. See forum for details.
 * OK, these changes effect a lot of file, I suggest everyone updates ASAP:
 * Removal of many files from project.
 * Removal of meanless Gr_bitmap_poly variable.
 * Removal of glide, directdraw, software modules all links to them, and all code specific to those paths.
 * Removal of redundant Fred paths that arent needed for Fred OGL.
 * Have seriously tidied the graphics initialisation code and added generic non standard mode functionality.
 * Fixed many D3D non standard mode bugs and brought OGL up to the same level.
 * Removed texture section support for D3D8, voodoo 2 and 3 cards will no longer run under fs2_open in D3D, same goes for any card with a maximum texture size less than 1024.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2003/11/17 04:25:56  bobboau
 * made the poly list dynamicly alocated,
 * started work on fixing the node model not rendering,
 * but most of that got commented out so I wouldn't have to deal with it
 * while mucking about with the polylist
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2003/11/01 21:59:21  bobboau
 * new matrix handeling code, and fixed some problems with 3D lit verts,
 * several other small fixes
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2003/10/25 03:26:39  phreak
 * fixed some old bugs that reappeared after RT committed his texture code
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2003/10/23 18:03:24  randomtiger
 * Bobs changes (take 2)
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2003/10/18 02:45:39  phreak
 * edited gr_d3d_start_instance_matrix to make it take a vector* and a matrix*, but it doesn't do anything yet
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2003/10/17 17:18:42  randomtiger
 * Big restructure for D3D and new modules grd3dlight and grd3dsetup
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2003/03/18 10:07:02  unknownplayer
 * The big DX/main line merge. This has been uploaded to the main CVS since I can't manage to get it to upload to the DX branch. Apologies to all who may be affected adversely, but I'll work to debug it as fast as I can.
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.5  2002/11/09 19:28:15  randomtiger
 *
 * Fixed small gfx initialisation bug that wasnt actually causing any problems.
 * Tided DX code, shifted stuff around, removed some stuff and documented some stuff.
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.4  2002/10/16 00:41:38  randomtiger
 * Fixed small bug that was stopping unactive text from displaying greyed out
 * Also added ability to run FS2 DX8 in 640x480, however I needed to make a small change to 2d.cpp
 * which invloved calling the resolution processing code after initialising the device for D3D only.
 * This is because D3D8 for the moment has its own internal launcher.
 * Also I added a fair bit of documentation and tidied some stuff up. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.3  2002/10/11 18:50:54  randomtiger
 * Checked in fix for 16 bit problem, thanks to Righteous1
 * Removed a fair bit of code that was used by the 16 bit code path which no longer exists.
 * 32 bit and 16 bit should now work in exactly the same way. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.2  2002/10/02 11:40:19  randomtiger
 * Bmpmap has been reverted to an old non d3d8 version.
 * All d3d8 code is now in the proper place.
 * PCX code is now working to an extent. Problems with alpha though.
 * Ani's work slowly with alpha problems.
 * Also I have done a bit of tidying - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.1  2002/09/24 18:56:42  randomtiger
 * DX8 branch commit
 *
 * This is the scub of UP's previous code with the more up to date RT code.
 * For full details check previous dev e-mails
