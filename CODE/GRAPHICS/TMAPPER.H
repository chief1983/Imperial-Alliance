 * no message
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2004/03/21 09:41:54  randomtiger
 * Fixed a bug that was causing windowed movie playback and a crash.
 * Added some batching redirection.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2004/03/05 09:02:01  Goober5000
 * Uber pass at reducing #includes
 * --Goober5000
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2004/02/16 11:47:33  randomtiger
 * Removed a lot of files that we dont need anymore.
 * Changed htl to be on by default, command now -nohtl
 * Changed D3D to use a 2D vertex for 2D operations which should cut down on redundant data having to go though the system.
 * Added small change to all -start_mission flag to take you to any mission by filename, very useful for testing.
 * Removed old dshow code and took away timerbar compile flag condition since it uses a runtime flag now.
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2004/02/15 06:02:32  bobboau
 * fixed sevral asorted matrix errors,
 * OGL people make sure I didn't break anything,
 * most of what I did was replaceing falses with (if graphicts_mode == D3D)
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2003/11/02 05:50:08  bobboau
 * modified trails to render with tristrips now rather than with stinky old trifans,
 * MUCH faster now, at least one order of magnatude.
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2003/10/23 18:03:24  randomtiger
 * Bobs changes (take 2)
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2003/10/16 00:17:14  randomtiger
 * Added incomplete code to allow selection of non-standard modes in D3D (requires new launcher).
 * As well as initialised in a different mode, bitmaps are stretched and for these modes
 * previously point filtered textures now use linear to keep them smooth.
 * I also had to shuffle some of the GR_1024 a bit.
 * Put my HT&L flags in ready for my work to sort out some of the render order issues.
 * Tided some other stuff up.
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2003/03/18 10:07:02  unknownplayer
 * The big DX/main line merge. This has been uploaded to the main CVS since I can't manage to get it to upload to the DX branch. Apologies to all who may be affected adversely, but I'll work to debug it as fast as I can.
 *
 * Revision 2.0.2.1  2002/11/11 21:26:04  randomtiger
 *
 * Tided up D3DX8 calls, did some documentation and add new file: grd3dcalls.cpp. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.0  2002/06/03 04:02:23  penguin
 * Warpcore CVS sync
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2002/05/02 18:03:07  mharris
 * Initial checkin - converted filenames and includes to lower case
 *
 * 
 * 4     6/29/99 10:35a Dave
 * Interface polygon bitmaps! Whee!
 * 
 * 3     12/06/98 2:36p Dave
 * Drastically improved nebula fogging.
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:49a Dave
 * 
 * 17    4/10/98 5:20p John
 * Changed RGB in lighting structure to be ubytes.  Removed old
 * not-necessary 24 bpp software stuff.
 * 
 * 16    4/09/98 7:58p John
 * Cleaned up tmapper code a bit.   Put NDEBUG around some ndebug stuff.
 * Took out XPARENT flag settings in all the alpha-blended texture stuff.
 * 
 * 15    4/09/98 4:38p John
 * Made non-darkening and transparent textures work under Glide.  Fixed
 * bug with Jim's computer not drawing any bitmaps.
 * 
 * 14    3/23/98 5:00p John
 * Improved missile trails.  Made smooth alpha under hardware.  Made end
 * taper.  Made trail touch weapon.
 * 
 * 13    11/21/97 11:32a John
 * Added nebulas.   Fixed some warpout bugs.
 * 
 * 12    10/15/97 5:08p John
 * added flag for alpha tmap
 * 
 * 11    3/10/97 5:20p John
 * Differentiated between Gouraud and Flat shading.  Since we only do flat
 * shading as of now, we don't need to interpolate L in the outer loop.
 * This should save a few percent.
 * 
 * 10    3/05/97 7:15p John
 * took out the old z stop tmapper used for briefing. 
 * 
 * 9     12/10/96 10:37a John
 * Restructured texture mapper to remove some overhead from each scanline
 * setup.  This gave about a 30% improvement drawing trans01.pof, which is
 * a really complex model.  In the process, I cleaned up the scanline
 * functions and separated them into different modules for each pixel
 * depth.   
 * 
 * 8     11/07/96 2:17p John
 * Took out the OldTmapper stuff.
 * 
 * 7     11/05/96 4:05p John
 * Added roller.  Added code to draw a distant planet.  Made bm_load
 * return -1 if invalid bitmap.
 * 
 * 6     10/26/96 1:40p John
 * Added some now primitives to the 2d library and
 * cleaned up some old ones.
