 * Revision 2.1  2004/01/24 14:31:27  randomtiger
 * Added the D3D particle code, its not bugfree but works perfectly on my card and helps with the framerate.
 * Its optional and off by default, use -d3d_particle to activiate.
 * Also bumped up D3D ambient light setting, it was way too dark.
 * Its now set to something similar to the original game.

 * Revision 1.1  2002/05/02 18:03:12  mharris
 * Initial checkin - converted filenames and includes to lower case
 *
 * 
 * 7     7/21/99 8:10p Dave
 * First run of supernova effect.
 * 
 * 6     1/29/99 12:47a Dave
 * Put in sounds for beam weapon. A bunch of interface screens (tech
 * database stuff).
 * 
 * 5     1/27/99 9:56a Dave
 * Temporary checkin of beam weapons for Dan to make cool sounds.
 * 
 * 4     1/24/99 11:37p Dave
 * First full rev of beam weapons. Very customizable. Removed some bogus
 * Int3()'s in low level net code.
 * 
 * 3     1/21/99 2:06p Dave
 * Final checkin for multiplayer testing.
 * 
 * 2     10/07/98 10:53a Dave
 * Initial checkin.
 * 
 * 1     10/07/98 10:50a Dave
 * 
 * 6     5/13/98 3:25p John
 * Added code to make explosion impacts not get removed by other
 * particles.
 * 
 * 5     5/11/98 10:06a John
 * Added new particle for Adam
 * 
 * 4     4/30/98 11:31a Andsager
 * Added particles to big ship explosions.  Modified particle_emit() to
 * take optional range to increase range at which pariticles are created.
 * 
 * 3     1/29/98 11:48a John
 * Added new counter measure rendering as model code.   Made weapons be
 * able to have impact explosion.
 * 
 * 2     1/02/98 5:04p John
 * Several explosion related changes.  Made fireballs not be used as
 * ani's.  Made ship spark system expell particles.  Took away impact
 * explosion for weapon hitting ship... this needs to get added to weapon
 * info and makes shield hit more obvious.  Only make sparks when hit
 * hull, not shields.
